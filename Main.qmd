# Kinematics

## Variables
**Position**

- Typically given by the variable $x$

**Time**

- Typically given by the variables $t$

**Displacement**

- Defined as the change in position ($X_f - X_i$)
- Given by the variable $\Delta x$

**Distance**

- You have to take the magnitude of vectors for every time you change position
- $S = |x_2 - x_1| + |x_1 - x_0| + ...$

**Average Velocity**

- Defined as the change in displacement over time
- $\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = V_\text{avg} = \bar{V}$

**Velocity**

- Defined as the change in displacement as time approaches 0
- $\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt} = V$

**Average Acceleration**

- Defined as the change in velocity over time
- $\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta t} = A_\text{avg} = \bar{A}$

**Acceleration**

- Defined as the change in velocity as time approaches 0
- $a = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta t} = \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$

**Speed**
- $\text{Speed} = \frac{S}{t}$
- Alternatively, when referring to vectors: $\text{Speed} = ||\vec{V}||$

## Kinematics: Velocity and Position Definitions (08/03 Homework)
The position versus time for a certain particle moving along the x axis is shown in the figure below. Find the average velocity in the following time intervals.

![](img/Kinematics%20Velocity%20and%20Position%20HW/problem1.png)

(a) 0 to 2s
  - 5.000m/s
(b) 0 to 4s
  - 1.250m/s
(c) 2 to 6s
  - -2.500m/s
(d) 1 to 7s
  - -1.667m/s
(e) 0 to 7s
  - -0.714s

## Derivative Relationships

**Acceleration and Velocity**

- $a = \frac{dV}{dt}$
- $V = \frac{dx}{dt}$
- $\int{V_0}{V} dV = \int_{0}^{t} a dt$
- $V\rvert_{V_0}^{V} = a\rvert_{0}^{t}$
- $V - V_0 = at$
- $V = at + V_0$

**Acceleration and Position**

- $V = \frac{dx}{dt}$
- $\int_{0}^{x} V dt = \int_{0}^{t} at + V_0 dt$
- $x\rvert_{0}^{x} = \frac{1}{2}at^2 + V_0t\rvert_{0}^{t}$
- $x = \frac{1}{2}at^2 + V_0t$

*If initial time or position is not zero:*

- $x-x_0 = V_0(t-t_0) + \frac{1}{2}a(t-t_0)^2$

### Given $x=4t^4 - 6t$, find $a$ when $t=2$.

\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= 16t^3 - 6 \\
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} &= 48t^2 \\
a &= 48(2)^2 \\
a &= 192
\end{align*}

## Practice with 1-D Kinematic Equations (moderate)

### Problem 1
A world-class sprinte rcan burst out of the blocks to essentially top speed (of about $11.5$ m/s) in the first $15.0$m of the race. What is the average acceleration f this sprinter and how long does it take her to reach that speed (she accelerates uniformly)?

### Problem 2
A car slows down from a speed of $25.0$m/s to rest in $5.0$s. How far did it travel in that time?

### Problem 3
In coming to a stop, a car leaves skid marks 80m long on the highway. Assuming a deceleration of $7.00 \text{m/s}^2$, estimate the speed of the car just before braking.

### Problem 4
A car traveling $45$km/h slows down at a constant $0.50 \text{m/s}^2$ just by "letting up on the gas." Calculate:

(a) the distance the car coasts before it stops 
(b) the time it takes to stop
(c) the distance it travels during the first and fifth seconds

### Problem 5
A car traveling at $90$km/h strikes a tree. The front end of the car compresses and the driver comes to rest after traveling $0.80$m. What was the average acceleration of the driver during the collision? Express the answer in terms of "g's," where $1.00\text{g} = 9.80 \text{m/s}^2$

### Problem 6
Determine the stopping distances for an automobile with ana initial speed of 90km/h and human reaction time of 1.0s:

(a) for $a =-4.0 \text{m/s}^2$
(b) for $a = -8.0 \text{m/s}^2$
